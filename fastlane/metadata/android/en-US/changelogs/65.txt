### Improvements

- Disable burgermenu icon animation #1486 
- undo delete of downloads #1472 
- Download option in share menu #1498
- Added share option to long tap menu #1454 
- Minimize main player on exit #1354 
- Library version update and database backup fix #1510 
- ExoPlayer 2.8.2 Update #1392
  - Reworked the playback speed control dialog to support different step sizes for faster speed change.
  - Added a toggle to fast-forward during silences in playback speed control. This should be helpful for audiobooks and certain music genres, and can bring a true seamless experience (and can break a song with lots of silences =\\).  
  - Refactored media source resolution to allow passing metadata alongside media internally in the player, rather than doing so manually. Now we have a single source of metadata and is directly available when playback starts.
  - Fixed remote playlist metadata not updating when new metadata is available when playlist fragment is opened.
  - Various UI fixes: #1383, background player notification controls now always white, easier to shutdown popup player through flinging
- Use new extractor with refactored architecture for multiservice
